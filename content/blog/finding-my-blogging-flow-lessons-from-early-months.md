summary: Six months into blogging, I’ve published fewer articles than planned. In this post, I examine why, challenge some common advice about writing, and explain how I’ll change my approach—including writing shorter posts and broadening the blog’s focus.

I started this blog at the beginning of the year, hoping to publish about one article per month. In reality, I managed only three articles in the first six months. It’s time to reflect and adapt my approach.

The main reason for this slower pace is that I set out to write only in-depth articles. Getting into “focus mode” for such writing requires uninterrupted time and serious commitment—something that’s hard to find in our busy lives. My original motivation was to produce quality content for readers, but to be realistic, I should probably take inspiration from Henrik Karlsson:

> Not that many people will care about what you write, at least for the first few years, so make the writing useful to you. Write in a way that lets you refine your thoughts about the things that matter. Write to experience what you care about in higher resolution, write to enhance your feeling of aliveness.

Another blogger I follow, [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), publishes several blog posts per day. Most are quotes or brief reflections, but as a reader, I still find value in them; they act as creativity pills for my own thoughts. This made me realize that posting shorter, more frequent reflections could help me build a sustainable writing habit by lowering the commitment threshold. It feels unnatural to relax my quality standards, but I’m also drawn to Jack Vanlightly’s perspective: focusing on quantity can actually improve quality over time.

> There is a well known story of a pottery class where the teacher split them into two groups. Half were told to focus on quantity and they would be judged by the number of works they produced. The other half were told they should go for quality over quantity, and would be judged by the quality of their work. The surprising result, as the story goes, was that the quantity over quality group produced more great pottery works than the group going for perfection.

> My own anecdotal experience with writing aligns with this story quite well.

Of course, these two pieces of conventional wisdom—“write for yourself” and “quantity over quality”—are cited everywhere online. Will they work for me? I don’t know, but if I don’t try, I’ll never know. Still, if in six months I find myself just churning out shallow content, I’ll need to reconsider this approach.

Lowering the bar for post length will also allow me to experiment with topics beyond tech. I’ve started reorganizing the blog with content categories. For now, there’s a “Tech” category, which includes all published posts. This change will make it easier to introduce an “Adventures” category later, where I can write about outdoor and sporty endeavors. The goal isn’t to split the blog in two—some posts may fit both categories—but to let readers filter what interests them.

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading. I hope to publish more soon—across a broader range of topics.
