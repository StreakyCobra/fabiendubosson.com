summary: A personal journey through Linux webcam woes, nostalgia, and plenty of tweaking‚Äîending with a script that finally helped me look human in meetings.

If there is one change that Linux users fear the most, it's switching to a brand new laptop. Even though hardware support is much better than when I first started 25 years ago, it is still a gamble to know if you picked one that will get all functionalities supported.

If you ever tried installing Linux on a Pentium 4 with a blurry CRT, you‚Äôll remember the joy and pain of hardware compatibility (and maybe Compiz cubes). Some things haven‚Äôt changed.

Nowadays, the main hardware troubles on Linux come from the webcam. New generation laptops come with MIPI webcams for which Linux support [is lacking][], to say the least. Fully aware of this fact, I managed to order a laptop that has a good old USB webcam that has a better chance of being supported on Linux ‚Äî it's more challenging than it sounds. For the curious out there, it's a [Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13][], but be warned, it is sold with both types of cameras.

After several evenings and weekend days installing and configuring Linux (sounds like a lot? May I introduce you to Arch Linux?) I finally got to the webcam test ü•Å ‚Ä¶ and it worked!

When I'm in meetings, I usually use the background seen above. The webcam worked, but I look rather pale in this picture. Not super pleasant for others, and not radiating a positive image. Webcam support is there, but it's not the out-of-the-box MacOS experience, for sure. That's the advantage when you control both the software and the hardware.

The downside of Linux is also one of its strengths: hackability. A few messages to ChatGPT later, I found out the command that shows the camera settings:

```
$ v4l2-ctl --list-ctrls

This may look intimidating at first, but brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, white balance temperature, sharpness... that's all familiar from photo editing! So I started by disabling automatic white balance ‚Äî which, on this hardware at least, seems to make things worse ‚Äî and began playing around with other parameters.

I spent a while tweaking brightness, contrast, and white balance settings, running dozens of variations until I hit something that I liked. Those numbers ended up in a script that runs at startup to set up the webcam, so I can finally look like a living human:

```bash
i_am_a_living_creature_fix_the_webcam___please() {
    v4l2-ctl -c brightness=97
    v4l2-ctl -c contrast=29
    v4l2-ctl -c saturation=64
    v4l2-ctl -c white_balance_automatic=0
    v4l2-ctl -c white_balance_temperature=4100
    v4l2-ctl -c sharpness=7
    echo "Applied favorite webcam configuration."
}
```

We probably won't all agree on the best configuration, but I think we can all agree that this version looks much better than the default one:

Let me know you have any suggestions to improve my appearance. And no, shaving the beard is not an option üòú
