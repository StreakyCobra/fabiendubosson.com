Hi, Iâ€™m Fabien, a software developer and data engineer working remotely from the mountains in Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­.

After earning a masterâ€™s degree in computer science, I spent a few years in academia before joining a startup that perfectly aligned with my interest in sustainable mobility. It was somewhat by chance that I began working on data engineering there, but it is through passion that I ultimately specialized in the field, while growing with the company and developing individual contributor (IC) leadership skills.

While my primary focus is on data engineering, Iâ€™ve maintained a strong curiosity for all things related to computers and software development. Whether itâ€™s Spacemacs, Rust, Fedora Atomic, git internals, or anything else that sparks my intellectual curiosity, Iâ€™m always eager to learn.

In my free time, I enjoy running trails in the mountains, especially the long and challenging ones. I also love travelling by bike, although I donâ€™t have much time for it at the moment. So, if youâ€™re into endurance sports or adventures, youâ€™ve got a great conversation starter!
