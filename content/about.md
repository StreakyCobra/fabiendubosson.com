Hi, I'm Fabien, a data engineer building sustainable mobility solutions from the Swiss Alps 🇨🇭.

My journey started with a master's in computer science and a stint in academia before I found my place at a startup working on sustainable transportation. What began as a research engineer role evolved into a deep passion for data engineering, a field where I've spent the last several years growing both technically and as a leader. As a senior individual contributor, I focus on platform engineering, enabling teams, and driving technical excellence through mentorship and architectural decisions.

Beyond data pipelines and infrastructure, I'm endlessly curious about the broader software ecosystem. Whether it's diving into Spacemacs configurations, exploring Rust's ownership model, experimenting with Fedora Atomic, or understanding git internals, I love learning how things work under the hood.

Outside of work, you'll find me on mountain trails, grinding through ultramarathons and long alpine runs. I also love bicycle touring, though my touring bags have been gathering dust lately. If you're into pushing limits through endurance sports or multi-day adventures, we'll have plenty to talk about.

If you're interested in data engineering, software craftsmanship, or swapping stories about suffering through beautiful landscapes, let's connect!
